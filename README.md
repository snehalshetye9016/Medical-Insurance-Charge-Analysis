# Medical-Insurance-Charge-Analysis
In our project, we explore the relationship between the insurance charges and factors (such as age, sex, BMI, number of children covered by health insurance, smoker, region) affecting it. To accomplish our goal, we employed hypothesis test, chi-squared test and linear regression model as our tool to investigate and identify several steps of our work.
